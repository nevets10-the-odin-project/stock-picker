# Project: Stock Picker

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-stock-picker

## Introduction

By now you should feel pretty good working with strings, arrays and hashes. We’ll do a couple of classic “intro to programming” problems in the next few lessons to help solidify your knowledge and get warmed up to working on small projects. You’ll need to rely on some of your basic knowledge of conditionals and flow control from the prep work but you shouldn’t need to do anything you haven’t seen before.

## Assignment

Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

## Note

I forgot to put a post project review on this project. I completed it in one afternoon, so I believe it was relatively simple.
